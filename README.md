My goal in this project was to use the Express framework in a Node.js application to construct a RESTful API. The API makes it simple to interact with data by retrieving it from a JSON file and making it available via a variety of endpoints.
Goals: Create a RESTful API using Express and Node.js.Effectively handle JSON data in a backend program.Implement the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods, which are essential for data management.Discover how to set up and configure a Node.js Express application that can read and write JSON data dynamically.Create RESTful APIs with clearly defined endpoints and routes.
I was able to understand the foundations of backend programming using Node.js and Express thanks to this project. It improved my knowledge of managing JSON data, creating RESTful APIs, and putting important HTTP techniques into practice. Even though it was difficult, it gave subsequent web development projects a strong basis.
